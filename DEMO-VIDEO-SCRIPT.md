## üìù **RECORDING TIPS**

### **Technical Setup:**
- **Screen Resolution:** 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Recording Software:** OBS Studio, Camtasia, or QuickTime

2. **Smooth Transitions:** Plan transitions between screens
3. **Highlight Important Data:** Circle or point to key information
4. **Keep Moving:** Don't pause too long on any screen
5. **Practice First:** Do a dry run to smooth out timing

### **Screen Management:**
- **Postman:** Zoom to 125% for better visibility
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Use full screen, zoom on collections
- **Terminal:** Large font size (16pt+)
- **Close Unnecessary Apps:** Clean desktop, close notifications

### **Backup Plan:**
- Have curl commands ready if Postman fails
